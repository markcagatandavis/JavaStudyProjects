BUG'S FIXED:
- Resolved Issue: PendingEnterPress not pausing when first being called.
- Resolved Issue: When pressing enter button, appends all following methods in ChapterOne.

CODE CLEANUP:
- Removed unneeded multithreading in NarratorReader Class.

BUG'S DETECTED:
- When pressing enter button, creates blank Enter Space on JTextArea.
- When enter button is pressed, ActionListener for pendingEnterPress is executing multiple times.
	DebugNotes: 
		DEBUG: This is reaching inside ActionListener
		DEBUG: Input Received, exiting while loop.
		DEBUG: This is reaching inside ActionListener
		DEBUG: Input Received, exiting while loop.

NEED TO ADD:
- Add Auto-Scroll, start of append text goes to top of JTextArea.

Notes:
- Looks like the PendingEnterPress method is being called and doing it's job of pausing thread till enterButton is pressed.
- To resolve blank space on enter press, maybe declare state to null for NarratorReader.
- ActionListener being executed multiple times might be due to time.seep in while loop.
